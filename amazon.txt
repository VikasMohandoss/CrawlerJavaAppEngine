 I have been using it for two weeks now and boy am happy to use it. I simply love the touch, feel and the speed with which it handles anything.
 <br />Amazon's delivery was excellent, i had gone for the 2 day delivery but received it within a day.
 <br />I have installed pretty heavy games but the Nexus runs it with ease.
 <br />The screen is mind blowing, the camera is decent but the only concern is the battery life, hope google comes up with a solution for that in android L and project volta.
 <br />Overall it's the best device in this office range.

 Bought my nexus 5 online from Amazon. Got a great deal on price. Product arrived well in time, nicely packed in Amazon branding. Of course on the inside was the premium google branding/packaging. Coming to the phone itself..well an absolute delight. Google has sure hit a sweet spot with the product features, its premium aesthetics, configuration and value for money. Been using it now for about 2 weeks.. Have ripped games, movies, apps, music, clicked pictures.. Overall been really happy with it.:) &lt;3 sure recommend ! Go buy!

 Hardware specs and performance are good. Usability is still not up to mark compared to iPhone or other basic feature phones. I have to read help for multiple scenarios. Basic being able to copy a phone number from a contact. Another instance is trying to forward a hangput . these are very common use cases and should have been made seamless. Phone interface is still not as per Google standards. It clubs received missed calls and dialled missed. Notes interface could be improved from usability.

 <br />
 <br />&#9830;Cons:
 <br />No in built FM
 <br />12(Actually 12.28) GB is all you to get to play around with your files and Data.
 <br />No micro SD slot(Non-expandable storage)
 <br />Loudspeaker is on the quiet side
 <br />Non user-replaceable battery
 <br />Comparatively less battery life
 <br />Low Light Camera is 7.5/10
 <br />
 <br />&#9830;Pros:
 <br />10/10 Most affordable phone with fastest Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chipset till the date.
 <br />10/10 &quot;Ok Google&quot; that is Google Now is much smarter now!!

 <br />8.5/10 USB host support, USB on-the-go support this time (Third party apps can give full support)
 <br />

 Amazon did a good job of delivering the package one day before it was supposed to. Fairly happy with the phone, I thought the transition from iOS to Android would be painful but that is not the case. Happy with the build quality of the phone, reviews that I had read said that the camera of this phone was not very good, however it beats the pants of my iPhone 4S. Delighted with the screen size, that's the biggest positive for me.

 Awesome phone, awesome service by Amazon..
 <br />Overall a great phone... Very responsive ( with its built in 2 GB ram, gorilla glass screen and fast processor), always up to date with software/patches etc.
 <br />The only downside is Camera, if you compare it with the likes of IPhone or even Samsung...
 <br />
 <br />But in general, being a customer of Nexus 4 and now Nexus 5, I am very satisfied with these phones.

 Hi, i happen to buy this expensive phone online after doing month long research and comparing specs.All in vain since i received a defective peice. The touch screem became in senstitive in just 20 days of use. I tried calling Amanzon and LG but they just kept saying that i need to carry my phone to the LG service station. I had no other choice. After getting the touch screen changed i found the inbuild earpiece does not work . The LG service station guys did nt even check the phone completely. I had to again go to the service station to get it repaired.
 <br />How can such defects arrise within 1 month of purchase. I am shocked by the quality of product i received and also by the attitude of LG service.
 <br />I wrote a note on the same to LG india but am yet to hear a reply from them.
 <br />Please dont buy any expensive gadgets online.
