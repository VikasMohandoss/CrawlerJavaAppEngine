This tablet was available at Rs. 21089 (with 5% off on credit card payment). I had planned to purchase this product. However, with this price increase, I am not willing to purchase the product at this price point.","It's a great device for rational buyers. If you are using a nexus 4 or 5, this is a scaled up version of that. It's really fast and has a superb display. For the configuration and price point, its currently the best available tablet in the market. Flipkart's service was not too impressive. The product had arrived at the nearest hub on Friday, and it took three more days to deliver it. There was also no option of quick delivery at time of purchase.","Everything is just perfect , specifications, display ,... only one thing lacking is ..company is not providing headphones for nexus....company or flipkart must give headphones with tablet","Well guys you can always find the specifications and its computing capabilities. This is a great TAB to own, and runs graphic intensive games very well. Excellent build quality, stunning look and feel in hands. Camera Pri and Sec are decent, however Primary camera could have been better. But one rarely use TAB for its camera. Speaker sounds low, however still good. I basically use TAB for almost everything including browsing, reading, gaming, social networking and other utility applications. Didn't had any lag in multitasking, 2 GB RAM takes care of it very well. I also bought a Cruzerlite Bugdroid Circuit Intelligent Wallet Case Black magnetic cover along with the TAB, which when turned back, locks the screen. So try and keep the flap open or use its half fold to separate some distance between the magnetic cover and Tab back.","very nice, small and handy kinds. Performance is very good, It cant beat iPad kind of tablets but it is best in its type :)","This is the device having all functional quad core snapdragon 600 1.5 ghz 2gb of lpddr3 ram best in class brilliant display whopping 323 ppi in 7 inch 3950 mah battery giving 1 day full backup plays asphalt 8 on high has best speakers but always getting muffled with your hands while playing or holding the tablet.Buy this one thing also it comes with stock android kitkat which makes the performance buttery smooth.","First off all great job done by Flipkart team to deliver the item well before expected delivery date. Now about Nexus, it is written Nexus 7 2014 may be because it is manufactured in 2014, mine is March 2014. Pros : - Wonderful crisp and clear screen - Smooth touch and gaming experience - Playes HD videos smoothly - Solid build quality - Descent battery back up. - Smooth browsing/ streaming experience - Great connectivity - No problem with GPS either - Runs on 4.4.2 Kitkat Cons : - Colurs look bit washed out while browsing in perticuler - Heats up quickly but never crossed 36 degree so it should not be a con..just mentioned... - Loud speaker volume bit slow Above experience after 10 days of use , will update again after 1 month...Thumbs up...!!!!","Asphalt 8 playable at High Tr2 no lag Subway surfers don't know whether problem in the game or something else as it lag NFS mw 2 yet to play 1080p playable within gallery Sound not so much in speakers Processor heating issue while opening 3or more tasks No problem with Ram and Memory","At first, Thanks flipkart! The tablet arrived at my doorstep the very next day that I ordered! Next- if you are looking for a tablet( without calling service), you can't get anything better than this! The minimal design and the beautiful display will leave you awestruck! I bought this device because it's probably the last of the nexus leanage. If you love vanilla android, go for it! I would probably refresh my review after using it for a month or so. I've never used a tablet as a daily driver and I'm yet to discover the thicks and thins. I'm more than eager to dive into this device, cheers! :)","Fast delivery by Flipkart. Seller WS Retail. Third purchase for me. Very good seller. Nexus 7C - Ultimate experience. Fast and crisp display. Smooth touch interface.","One of the finest tabs, I've used. This one is fast, does all that is needed for a daily routine and keeps going long hours with the battery (with regular use for mails, music, reading and occasional browsing) for about 8-9 hours. The tab is ideal to hold by hand and is very convenient to operate with. the screen is a big plus to the tablet giving the resolution clarity, speakers are good but max volume is pretty low. On the whole a great tablet.","the best tab for us Google fans---no frills and assured quality. Speed of downloads is amazing. KItkat is buttery. Pleasure to hold it in hands, as this offers maximum utility on my travels. And order through FK, you automatically derive the right to look outside for immediate delivery. Good work, FK.","Delivery done in one day only, hats off to flipkart and Nexus 7 is indeed beast of all tablets except one flaw no sms sending & phone calling.","Technical specs apart (which others have covered in detail), this is a very sleek model and lightweight. So while a cover will help, using this tab is a delight. Battery is not great I believe. Flipkart's service is amazing.","Smooth operation and perfect Tablet.. Loved the way it is in my hand.. cute little pal .. No need to Go for Ipad or Samsung galaxy.. its the fantastic product.. Buy it blind hooded..","If you are looking for any tablet in android or if you are looking for any tablet at all then go for Nexus 7C and don't ever give a second thought to it because it is the best!! Speaking about its performance this tab can go on and on with its 2GB RAM, playing a game, meanwhile you wanna check your facebook notification, make a quick search in your browser or do some bank jobs! Name it all and it happens in a jiffy! BEST BUY!!!","This simply supereb tablet in the market right now, even better than IPAD mini in many areas.. and also flipkart delivery is very good....they are selling it much cheaper than in Chroma OR other retail outlets but still quality is same so no doubts otherwise...comes with warranty card and invoice..gr8!!","I am using this tablet since last 6 months and it worth every penny. Never got hanged, no lag so ever. You can throw any app or games to it and it run butter smooth. I am excited to upgrade it to 4.4.3","The price shown on the website for this item was 22999 and the combo offer was Rs. 23677. But when I placed the order the total amount increased by another 3000. Today morning the price in your web is again 22999 and combo price Rs. 23677. This is cheating","Awesome tablet to own. value for Money .. Totally worth it. Only draw back is no SD card support. otherwise ticks all specifications!!","It's a really good tab. Since it's nexus, apps run smoothly. And you can connect your pen drive and hard disk using OTG cables. Sim slot facility makes net usage easy. Loving it.","Speed and Performance was very good. I like the product very much Flipkart delivery was awesome. Got the shipment before 2 days.","What a tablet I run out of words to say .you can see the review how people are so crazy about this tablet .In any site u can check it comes in best 05 tablets in many gadget site it is no 1 tablet thanks flip kart for such a great tablet . Now already one month past no problem very smooth,Very fast, 2 gb ram makes this tablet awesome.","recieved product (go for it, best thing on the market) BUT WS HAS NOT CONTACTED ME ABOUT MY RETURN REQUEST!!!! THERE ARE PURPEL SPOTS ON THE SCREEN, PIXEL DE-COLORATION, NICE BIG SPOT IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN i have put in return request on 28!! havent heard back, are they gonna wait for the 30 day period to end ?? one star for service issues, product is great","whatever good u have heard about the nexus 7 2013.... it is all true. the screen is uncomparable. it feels wonderful and light. the only complain is that the seller did not offer a screen guard along with the shipment, but it was amazing!","booked on 11th may ,got it nxt day under normal delivery conditions,kudos to flipkart for their service. Coming to the tab...absolute flawless config.I use this tab only for taking out Esugam forms and mailing stuff ..little of browsing .it has given a battery back up for 2.5 days for very minmial usuage. cons: if ur using apps lyk MONEY CONTROL ,tab hangs for the first time ...cautious about certain big and medium apps on ur TAB. Else its perfect TAB for everyday use compared to the expensive APPLE STUFF...","I purchased this product on 16th May and quite happy with the services of flip kart. They delivered the product in just two days. Touch response and Video display is awesome. Camera is decent. There is no lag and you can run multiple program simultaneously. Although its not negative but for the first time installation and set up you must have Wi-fi connection. While transfering the data via usb to device on xp you may require some settings in pc . It supports 3g /4g sim without calling No external memory Overall its excellent to have this product provide you have the budget of 24K.","Great Speed, Ample amount of space, Robust Graphics & state of the art display. In short its a sure buy. One thing I want to tell all my readers, If you've ever experienced lag in any previous Android device, you'll just amaze to see its performance... It's just NO LAG android experience with most beautiful display till now.","Pros - Excellent Display Quality & Resolution. - Excellent Built Quality. - Excellent Performance in User Interface, Apps & Gaming Too. - Latest android updates - Good Battery Backup Cons. - No calling facility (it does have sim card slot) - No 4G network support in India - Poor Camera Performance - No Earpiece on device As Usual Excellent Shipping & Packaging from Flipkart (WS Retail) :-)","Why in India , this 4G model is being sold ? This model 4G LTE supports 2100 MHz (i.e. Band 17 or 20) where as in India , only Airtel provides 4G LTE network having 2300 Mhz (i.e. Band 40) . So this 4G is of no use in India as of now. If Google comes up with any new model suitable for India's 4G network, that would be a great deal. Again, they don't have a model which only supports 3G + WiFi (no 4G) with lesser cost. There is no point of buying a 4G enabled device paying extra money which is of no use in India as of now. But overall, rest all features are awesome , there is no doubt on it.","speaker blown in 3 months, contacted service centre, they said they cannot fix the tablet speaker and asked to contact the toll free number. service centre address was given to me by the toll free number guy. buy only if you r sure u will not need the service or are ready to throw the device if hardware breaks down. note: Dont buy/encourage devices which have poor or no service backup like google devices. there were three centres in amtitsar when i bought the product but now none of them is giving service. they have been listed on the site just to foool and mislead prospective buyers","I purchased this tablet (2012 edition) on Flipkart somewhere in November 2013 and it has already developed technical issues (hardware issues with the motherboard). I got the motherboard replaced and a new issue has cropped up (i.e. the tablet does not start). Have been facing this issue since 3 weeks and there seems to be no solution in sight!!!","Always knew this would be good, it turned out to be great. Love the way it performs. Technically as well as look and feel wise its a great product.","Google and Asus really standout with the Nexus 7, a terrific small-screen tablet + Rs.28000 + Load of feature. I really really like this tablet, it is light, easy to use and very nice specifications.","BUY RIGHT NOW,I am a valid nexus user and have tested many products so far this is the best!, Price tag is simply great so far ,defiantly must buy","Goggle Nexus 7'' is best in the market now. Internet Speed by 3G as well as Wifi matches its calibre. It is weight is very less making it easy for mobility. Doesn't have 'Talk facility'. For me It is better because you can't always dug in an ear phone or BT headset always","Hello buyers! Think before you buy this tablet. It is written 2G but it do not have VOICE CALLING and MESSAGING. So better you buy anyone else. If you do not want calling and messaging , this tablet is for you.","good one. but with no voice calling means phone could not be done.Good processing speed.Camera is good........................................................................................................................","this was my first online shopping with flikpart n it was great! About the tab, in first week i was using it nonstop n it was a great feeling. After a 1 week, I felt the missing of the calling feature in this tablet n now im struggling to make calls.. so i would say, if anyone wants a tablet with call facility just go for asus fonepad!","I see many reviews about sound quality and volume is decent/good.I don't understand what people are writing about. Volume is too low to hear anything if you switch on fan/you are on a car. I was thinking this as some hardware/software issue and went to asus exclusive showroom. There also I see this tab volume is same. I am not a music lover or a person careful about sound quality. But bare minimum sound volume is expected from this tab. What is the point of having dual speaker if it cannot generate sound. My entry level mobile phone has double the volume of this tab. I tried some app to boost the volume but no luck. In all other aspects this tab performs pretty well.","I would have seriously bought this product if it supported voice calling........OMG I just wanted it..........Skype And Viber wont fulfil my needs","1. Sleek design 2. Value for money 3. Decent camera 4. Battery lifetime higher 5. Android paradise And as usual amazing delivery from Flipkart. Keep up the good work guys!","Guys, this is the tablet which I was waiting from past few months...Oly after grabbing it in my hands I felt like am handling a Laptop as if...The UI is spectacular, talking abt the speed its really awesome no words actually. Playing Asphalt 8 airborne Game is itself an example for the Graphics. Oly issue is Heating up, which I guess in the cmg version of Kitkat it maybe resolved. Overall a mindfucking TABLET it is!!! GOOGLE plz launch ur flipcover also for this TAB.","Great delivery service by flipkart!!.... I got it delivered within 48 hours of placing the order, Nexus 7 32GB wifi + 3G is an ultimate tab in mid range tabs. Besides the best specs available in the market, it comes bundled with Kitkat version of Android. Performance is amazing. no lag, super flow, crisp display and smooth touch screen is an icing over the cake. Crisp display gives reading a new experience, it feels like reading from a print. No option for expansion of memory is a catch but.. again this is done for better hardware/software integration... meaning better performance. While Samsung is yet to launch its Tab 8.4 pro in India, which will be priced around 36k to 40k, Nexus 7 is ready to place a tough competition.","Just ordered fabulous Nexus 7c 2013 32GB WiFi-LTE model, which is one of the best android tab. Hope flipkart deliver the product as they used to always......","Nexus 7 is my daily part of life after i bought in flipkart. large memory, 2 gb RAM, 7 inch screen, lots of apps, games, songs, pics. Thanks to Flipkart. Small Problem is no customized case available in india for nexus 7.","Initially had a problem enabling the 3G but got it sorted out now its working like \"butter\" really impressed with google's project butter as well as the tablet itself !!!","People run after Apple, samsung, htc, sony but i ask why to look for those costly products when with same configurations you can buy nexus 7 in almost 10k less price. I have been using it since dec 17 2013. First of all Flipkart Service is very good, for some reason i was not available at the destination for receiving the product and they accepted my request of delaying it for one more day...thanx for that... now come to the product... Pros- 1. it's google product, first of all updates come for this. 2. Nice hardware i have been totally comfortable in handling it. It's one of the sleekest and slimmest of the tabs. 3. Lot to say about battery backup. It is absolutely good. I have tested it thoroughly. 5 hours non-stop gaming discharged it. 4-5 hours non-stop video playing can be easily handled. If we use moderately like 1 hour gaming, 1 hours video playing, internet using for 2 hours, and rest of the daily works it will easily last for whole day. it hardly gets discharged when you are not using it. 4. touch is unbelievably smooth, never found any glitch in last 4 months. 5. fantastic for reading even smaller fonts appear clear. 6. absolutely bright screen. all angles view without any blur. 7. real gaming tab. Asphalt 8 works without any glitch. 8. Internet broswing is really a good experience on it. 9. Rear Camera is quite good in day light. The front camera for video chat give clear picture more than u expected. 10. speakers are quite good. Enough loud and with clear sound. cons- 1) rear camera do not have flash. 2) do not support call facility. 3) no case with the product. should have been given by google considering the cost of device. Only these three cons otherwise everything is absolutely fine about this tab...but still it deserves 5 stars.","I was looking for a portable tablet, size 7-8 inches. I zeroed down to the ipad mini with retina display and nexus 7. Turned out the ipad mini was priced too steep and a little research on both the product revealed that they are very similar. The ipad wins in being a premium looking product but the nexus is priced amazingly. The only deciding factor to me was the screen aspect ratio and android OS 4.4 (as I already use 4.3 on my GS3). I weigh function over style at any given time for the money I invest. My normal use: Movies during my commute, games (asphalt 7, angry birds, dead trigger) Pros 1. The price. 2. Build quality is robust. 3. The screen does not score as high as a super AMOLED or Retina Display but it is an IPS LED and does a very impressive job with HD movies and Games 4. The processor and RAM are ample for Day to day use. 5. NFC, wifi direct are pretty useful for transferring stuff. Thinking of buying Chromecast for HD TV. 6. Android 4.4 has so many better features. 7. No voice calling (its a goo thing for me). 8. The camera has many features but I have not used it often. 9. Stereo speakers are pretty loud and I like them Cons 1. The abundance of cases and covers cannot be compared with ipadmini. 2. No OTG (on the go) feature that helps me connect a USB connector to access any pen drive or my OTG pend drive (it works brilliantly with my GS3) so no quick memory as the device lacks expandable memory. But 26/32 GB is available which is ample for me. 3. The screen without a screen guard is a fingerprint magnet so use a good screen guard.","nice tab .. fully loaded features.. super fast .. battery is not the best. Tab without calling facility. u can only use data calls via apps like skype, viber, etc..","nice piece of hardware. a great upgrade from 1st gen. multitasking lags a bit with android 4.4 .2 kitkat version,but it's satisfactory. battery could have been better. gaming for a long period is not recommended, although games run quite smoothly. if you are a e-book or e-magazine reader, or a fan of portability where important businesses or works come into play( I meant this as a laptop replacement in this case, every laptop work can't be done on a tablet), then this tablet is highly recommended. a good cover is suggested with this.","good product, nice packing, waiting for my 4g card to explore my new nexus 7 LTE tablet.. if you are looking for a cheap and better tablet for gaming and browsing , then i'll prefer nexus only..","No words for its quality - An excellent tab ever! Fantastic resolution, wonderful featurs and most importantly highly affordable as far as its price is concerned. Highly recommended for those who love and enjoy pdf and document reading on tab. Cheers to Google ! Cheeers to Flipcart!!","Product was in very good shape. packing was also great. I also got excellent discount on the product. The total price was very low compare to other online sites. The date of delivery was also accurate. I was also able to keep track on my product delivery process. I am really happy that I bought this product from flipkart.","fantastic screen, not so great battery, voice calls not supported, unable to get data on 3G. still pleased with the overall experience. it is possible that there is something i dont understand about making the 3G work, although i have had help from professionals","Its a great devise. Using it for a while now. The best thing was the delivery speed, less then a week. :)","Amazing product, excellent delivery and service on time in perfect condition. I bought it for my friend and he cannot keep his hands off it. The tab is superfast and value for money. The only drawback is the inability to add an extra memory card. Other than that a definite \"buy\".","What to say about this product. My friend got 2 of this tabs for the 1st time before it was launched in INDIA from USA> I fell in love with this tab as it had got amazing blend of perfect size (portable), amazing scene resolution (crystal clear display), and powerful engine (nice speed and graphics). Playing games is a ultra smooth experience. I have got 2 tables of this - one for me and other for my wife. Now one of my other friend also purchased and also one more want to purchase it soon. So in my group of 5 friends we will have 6 Nexus tabs. Now if u need more reviews on this than why dont u get one and see it for urself. :p","Google at it's best....awesome tablet with excellent graphics and speed....very fast and Safe service from flipkart .\u2026.","Delivery from Flipkart was prompt, though there was a small issue with timing of the delivery. Nonetheless no complaints on that. Tablet is working to my satisfaction. I guess this is value for money, in comparative terms to the iPads and the Samsung's of the world.","pros 1. nice slim design 2. 2 GB ram support is enough to play any tab game. 3. display is awesome 4 . no heating problem , while playing high graphics games cons. no call support.","Issues # Corning gorilla glass still it is prone to scratches # No proper platform to get details of SIM being used. Benefits # Best Display # Very Light in weight # Perfect gripping # Slim As if u r holding a small file # Slides in pocket as if it squeezes itself in my pocket # Camera is good its a tab. @@ GET IT to b A PROUD OWNER @@","Best tablet at the moment . Video playing is a charm. Internet surfing is in a jiffy . No lag, no hang. Folks, you may go for it .","Awesome tablet... Has good configuration and has great performance. Camera quality is bit less but that's okay we don't want DSLR in the tablet. Works smooth on high end games also.","Minus the camera in low light situations, and No voice calling feature (despite having sim facility), This tab is the best tab of 2013 coming into 2014. No hitch, No glitch smooth as silk. Works with charm and has good display of colors plus good battery life. Power management is good as well.(having kitkat helps). Surfing internet is pretty fast. 3G drains battery faster than wi-fi( an observation). Overall satisfaction 100%, minus 10% for no voice call features= 90%. Calling using headset should have been provided. Also, earphones sound is generally average(having good headset is recommended). Don't expect the inbuilt dual speakers to 'wow' you, coz they won't. they are decent not excellent. P.S. Very disappointing that can't make calls. Have to root it sooner or later. ;) :P","Screen: 5/5 Speed: 5/5 OS: 5/5 Looks: 4/5 Touch: 3/5 Sound:3/5 its good for price but not without issues. Compromise made and is pretty evident. It's still the best deal for its price...","The tablet is good, coming prepoulated with the google products. Videos get rendered well, games are good. 7\" in good size for all these and social networks. Camera isn't the best one and the pictures were a bit grainy, still looking at any settings that I could have missed. Do not, DO NOT, update to the latest version of 4.4.2 The tablet became unresponsive to touch and had to be replaced.","This is farmost the best TAB I came accross. Best processor, best graphics. Do buy this without any hesitation","Display too gud....power too gud......speaker volume may disappoint you...but gaming performance and fast fast fast performance of dis beast gonna make your decision crrct .","Hi..Flipkart team. in a word to describe you is Awesome. 1. I got a very good deal 2. Delivery of the product is mind-blowing 3.The delivery person is very informative ( Mr.Anbarasu ) 4.The tab i got has a problem (Nexus -7C) in touch.i don't blame flipkart but the good point is i got a replacement in two days .possible i give 5+ Star 5. Overall the point is my first purchase is my best i ever made 6. A product is good 4+ for Nexus 7C","Few days back i had ordered this tabket and was delivered to me in a day. Ample research was cone before i made the purchase and i ended up finalising the 32 gig cellular version as i dint want to tether from my cell phone in office. Spec wise its a beast and runs bertery smooth. Setting up cellular version is a little tricky in India as you have to set up APN settings manually. Display is the main attraction of this tab and it simply is gorgeous. Overall a great buy for any version which suits your need. Highly recommened and a total value for money proposition.","I am editing this review after 9 months of usage. this tablet i still a great one. but screan quality litrally sucks. just now the screen got cracked. i was mear 6 inch fall. do not buy this device if u have slippery hands. and to replace the screen it will cost 10k. come on asus!!!!! its half of the device cost. its getting outdated anyhow no one is bothered. Thanks This is my first tab.. And I waited an year For this.I am not a android fan buy. But I love a personal device. I love watching movies n games. And this 7inch tab is serving my needs. Best display n raw power makes the gaming experience heaven. Asphalt 8,GTA San,nova anything u throw it will play seamlessly. I charge it to once a day with average usage, but full on gaming it will last for 4 hours. U can easily watch 3 movies with average brightness and headphones. Sound quality is average. But dual speakers makes up to it. With Nfc I could only transfer only webpages with lumia and WiFi direct is still a mystery. I am loving it so far.. Go ahead and buy it. FLIPKART I LOVE YOUR SERVICE... will write on more review in coming days.........","Made for you by Google (Well not technically) but thats the feeling that you get .. Only downside is lack of calls however it doesnt matter when u start using the tab.. u dont feel it Amazing tab all said and done and the ultimate tab i would say","Pros: Screen looks brilliant. Volume is pretty good. Light weight and feels good in hands. Play magazine app from Google was specially great. Battery lasts long. (lasts 2-3 days with a few hours of usage each, including reading long hours). Cons: Touch has issues, specially while press & hold e.g. in Chrome to open links.","thanks to flipkart for shipping me product in just 2 days. when i first saw the display of this tab,i fall in love . guys it has got amazing screen . but the problem i faced is that tab automatically shuts down .when i was recording a video while transferring some data on bluetooth to my lappy. it gave me a little bit worry. second , issue i faced and still facing that it is very hard to acquire micro sim from microsim port ,. really very hard and pin which i got nexus does nt help much :( u will have to try a lot.","Cons: This tab does not have a call facility. If you are looking for call facility it doesnt have. It has a micro sim for data plan only. Pros: Its a good tablet with an extra feature of restricted users, where the users can be upto 8.","I just received this tab 2 days back, the performance is good, it supports all the games(like nova 3, robocop, fifa 14 and many more).graphics are awesome, camera is good, updates with the latest android version(4.4.2) easily, the only thing bad about d tab is that the tab heats up quickly even while playng normal games for half an hours!!! otherwise i would rate this tab with 5 stars","Not a single issue that I could find with this device. Brilliant performance, much better than Tab Plus (P6200), which I bought last year at a similar price range. Well done Google and Asus !!","Hey guys..... as usual i got d product much earlier than they told to delievr me. Its an fantastic Tab. Nexus 7 2013 supr hit. Vry smooth to use. Vry good bttry. Its vry affordable with d huge configuration..","If the Nexus 7 , 2012 was a loss leader, the nexus 7,2013 is a category shaker. Fully loaded with an attractive price to boot, Nexus 7 2013 is the real headache for Cupertino .","I read through the features and even used my friends tab for sometime and it was a superb never before experience. Though I had a query. Will it support LTE in 2300Mhz band which is alloted to current 4G operators like Reliance Jio Infocomm and Bharti Airtel. Because on another website it was mentioned as follows: LTE: 700/850/1700/1800/1900/2100 MHz","Flipkart Delivery the Best..The product was delivered in 15 hours. Coming to Nexus 7, I was at first confused whether to buy Nexus & or Ipad Mini 2.. Though Ipad looks bigger and better build, its priced 15k more for the same cellular model. Thats too much for a product in India. Screen is Bright and with Kit Kat it runs like a Beast. Even with several apps in the background it doesnt lag anywhere.Speaker sound is pretty good. Its definitely worth the BUY..","Just got it from FLIPKART . I got it two days before from their actual delivery date, so I will give 5 to flipkart regarding the delivery. After unpacking I just stunned to see the champ. More I will update after few days.","Bought the Nexus 7 2013 LTE version a month ago and I have been using it since on a daily basis. This is my first tablet and having read all the reviews on many other tablets, I decided this was the one to have and so far I haven't been disappointed in any shape or form (touch wood). I have basically tested most of the features on the tablet and it works like a charm. Couple of things I haven't tried yet, which are, connecting to HDMI using slim port and OTG. Other than that, its a perfect tablet for one to have.","It's a best table at this time. Wonderful picture quality, good gaming experiance and very handy to use.","You don't need to think twice before buying this tablet if you are already an android user. This is the best you can get at an incredibly low price.","I am very happy I chose this one over an i-pad mini with retina display. The display is crisp and excellent; build quality sleek and suave and the usp of the Nexus 7 is definitely its price and portability. The fact that one can easily hold this tablet in one hand is a huge advantage. The interface offered by the latest Android \"kitkat\" is buttery smooth and delightful. Flipkart's delivery was, as usual, spot on and fantastic. Received the tablet in perfect condition and packing. One word for prospective purchasers. Unlike the earlier version of nexus 7, the 2013 version does not come with the quick start guide in the box so don't think you have been short changed by the seller, which I initially did. The Google support site helped clarify the position. Also, the tablet just got hanged 2 days after purchase and did not move beyond the booting icon but got the reset done after going through the process described by others online. A users guide with the product would definitely have helped. Have faced no issues ever since and am enjoying this tablet. The speakers could have been much better too. The iPad mini beats this tablet on this parameter hands down. However, let this not deter buyers from going for it. It is overall, a wonderful product.","First I would like to tell that I haven't bought it from here and got it as a gift from my uncle who is in Australia.In general flipkart has a great track record for me. Delivery is fast and return process is hassle free. Coming to the Nexus 7 2013, I must say it stole my heart the moment I turned it on. The display is brilliantly bright and gives natural colors which are not punchy like Samsung devices ( I FIND THEM AWKWARD ON NOTE 2) The processor is not the fastest on earth but does everything with ease. It is been 10 days since I am running it and no lag whatsoever. The 2gb ram has much more availability due to lack of bloatware which is what nexus devices are known for. Well it is true Apple class on smoothness and ease of operation while maintaining android's flexible chracter . The battery life is so-so for HD games (which you will get addicted to on this gem of a tablet) and the top gets heated. But for reading and surfing web. the battery just ROCKS! Audio might seem low but has a surround effect. If you want more loudness, turn off the surround effect in Google Play music which sacrifices the stereo effect. I have not bought any screen gaurd as Gorilla glass is good for regular protection. Wish they added oleophobic layer on it. On the downside the Wi-Fi version needs you to connect to Wi-Fi for first boot ( you can make hotspot on your phone for that and then data on). Please never buy 16gb version ax it will certainly run out of storage soon. If you still want to be on budget, get Wi-Fi only 32gb from elsewhere. All and all a great device... Stunning display, powerful processor, latest updates and whatever you can think of.IT IS NOT A LAPTOP SUBSTITUTE, for that you can get a Note pro or tab pro 12","Researched a lot before jumping on to buy this little wonder and it is an absolutely delightful toy. - Performance during gaming (even heavy games like Frontline Commando) runs extremely smoothly on it) is brilliant. - Full HD display is a delight. - The look and feel of the device is pretty good, the rubberized back looks very stylish. - The best part is holding comfort (one of the main reasons i chose this over an iPad), with its slim design and rubberized back its very comfortable in hands for reading, gaming and general usage. - One major con which many people have discovered since the upgrade to KitKat is that the SMS functionality has been done away with. So if you have a 3G plan that requires you to send an SMS, it may not be possible with this. So choose a connection that you can manage from an online account. - Battery performance is just about alright. I have not used tablets much but a single charge lasts a working day with 3G/Wifi on all time, an hour of gaming, an hour of browsing and an hour of other general use. However it charges pretty quickly. The delivery and packaging from Flipkart was amazing as usual.","This tab is a nice product from Google and ASUS except for some minor issues. I always believed ASUS is best hardware in market and this product proves my belief. The battery of tablet is not powerful. Drains quickly. For an LTE model the battery should have been of higher size. No call facility or SMS facility. You cannot use SMS to activate services on your micro sim. Rating 4 due to lack of SMS facility and low powered battery.","The best possible tab in market as of now! The screen has multi touch support for ten fingers! The ram is superior to tabs in general. Is a better option than iPad coz obsolescence is higher for iPad thus nexus is more value for money.","Superb tablet. Great resolution (1920 X 1200). No lags at all even while playing high graphics oriented games.Camera is okay, i mean you can't expect a great camera in a tablet that provides you high performance in such a low price.Biggest plus point, this device will get updates before any other android device. Battery life is nice 10 hrs continuous usage and up to 2 days in stand by mode. The only problem that i face is that, the device gets a bit heated only when you are playing high graphics oriented games for a long time so avoid doing that. This tablet would have been a greater hit in india if it would have allowed voice calling too, but again you can't expect too much, be happy with what you get at such a reasonable price :P","I am so overwhelmed by my first choice of buying a tab i.e NEXUS 7 2013 LTE..Blazing speed , light weight, crystal clear pictures , music quality ,gaming .etc .All in one tab. flipkart is best in delivering the product. A happy customer..","This is my first tab ever use, also in first time the android system. after use a week, I feel great. work well, picture quality and other specification achieve. after a long study of review I selected this model for my daughter's study and me. little confuse about the small screen, but its more comfort for me at all. all positive, but I feel much problem about its use. asus do not provide any user manual or guidance. there are no help in sites. so, till the date I do not expert about all its specification and use. I will writing another review after a month. I recommend the product for serious tab lovers.","If you are looking for a product which can give competition to a high end high price product like apple ipad mini then this is what you want. with the same price range there is no other product which even comes near to it. Loving my Nexus 7 (2013) :D","Google have done it again.. value for money... Many fellows have given a better review already I would like to mention following two cons 1. you cannot make a call from this device 2. Battery expires pretty sooner when playing HD and Wifi download parallel If you have charger ports available with you all the time.. Just go for it.. ::))","After reading excellent reviews of this tablet, I decided to buy one even though I had very recently bought Nexus 7, 2012 model. I am impressed but not what I had expected. The colors are jaded and no match for my mobile phone Nexus 4. Even the contrast is low. Also color fringes are present in text and monochrome images. I think old Nexus 7 has more value for money.","i have purchased this tab from flipkart on 19th December,2013. orederd on 14 December. the order i received before the due date. And it was well packed and safely received. Tab is just gr8 with great features. Overall its a great experience buying this tab from flipkart","Everything what i expected is bit more than that, but i still find some issue with this tablet, i cant fix the Bluetooth, as it doesn't detect any device. guys plz help me sort out this problem.","I purchased this amazing Nexus 7'inch C tablet for new year :) and am enjoying it. This is the great tablet with high resolution among all the tablets available today. E-books clarity is more than apple mini. Apps download speed is so fast ...! Gaming experience is very much accurate and this is the best gadget ever i used for gaming !!! So fast....So bright.... So accurate and so handy..! I am very much satisfied with this ! Thanks to Asus and Google.","This is my forth tablet ... the previous ones include, iPad, Galaxy Note 10.1. However, this the first one with LTE and 32 GB, other ones are mostly wifi and 3G and all 16GB. This one is really cool! I like it and would recommend for all of you. My next target is iPad mini with Retina. BTW: Flipkart promised delivery in a weeks time, but delivered it with in 2 days... very impressive!!","I just ordered it from flipkart and let me tell you guys its perfomance is amazin and battery back up is also good... i mean iam a freak game user and it still lasts a whole day even when i hav 3g...","The device performs well. It deals with almost anything on the play store with ease. The 32gigs alongside cloud storage on the 3g version is more than enough - and you wont find the need for external memory. The screen is everything here - its crystal clear and the daylight visibility is superb. The camera's are both effective enough. And while most complain about the rear camera - i think google has kept the spec a little low so that you dont end up looking like a berk taking photos using a tablet. The one issue some may face is with the screen - certain areas maybe dead and you will notice this when using the swipe keyboard when oriented horizontally. Other than that the bezel could have been smaller.","The most apt name for this tab. Beauty in terms of its design. Sleek,thin and with a matte black finish at the back. The nexus logo looks oh so stunning in the middle and there is a reason why its written in landscape. Then, we come to the screen. Oh what a screen! Full HD 1080p of sheer viewing goodness and pleasure. Weather its watching a movie or reading a book, it is just gorgeous & crisp. That's the beauty part. Now the beast. The beast is the processor,the quad core chipset is just ideal for multi-tasking, coupled with 2 gigs of ram. You throw anything at, absolutely anything nd it just chews it up without a hitch. Battery life is also excellent. Very less drain of battery in standby. Even if you leave it overnight, hardly 1-2% of the battery gets discharged, which is very good for an android device. That's got a lot to do with the software I think, and its aces in that department as well. As son as I powered it on and connected it to wifi (it needs wifi for the initial setup) it straight a way asked me to upgrade to the latest version of android 4.4.2 from 4.3. You'll get the latest software updates, only with the nexus,quickly & efficiently. Even the cameras, both back & front are quite decent. The 5MP offering at the back does quite a decent job, and shoots full HD video as well. Quite decent for a a tablet. All in a all a great tablet. The best in the 7\" tablet space. If there is one thing that lets it down then probably its the fact that in Delhi we don't get 4G LTE. Hopefully it becomes available soon. Also there is no calling feature built in, but I guess everyone now a days has a phone to do that. In the end, for me its the best tablet money can buy right now in terms of value for money. The price - to - feature ratio is phenomenal. The I-pad mini doesn't come close to this. If you want a tablet, you have to go for this. If network connectivity is not all that important and you can survive on wifi then the 16gb or 32gb wifi only models are your best bet. I must also put in a great word for flipkart. Speedy delivery. 1 complaint I do have is that they don't seem to deliver in Noida. I had my tab delivered to a friend in gurgaon. Hopefully this will get sorted out soon. Kudos to flipkart and to asus (and google) for giving us (I think) the VFM gadget of the year. You also get a slice of your own Google Goodness!!!","Overall a nice product but its battery is too week and takes lot of time to get charge, but other features are good.","Didn't find anything that's missing for my needs. Well one drawback I realized late after kit Kat update was that sms feature for 3g Sim is lost.","Got it in just two days of placing the order, on powering on the device fro the 1st time and connecting it to wifi it took the kitkat 4.4.2 update instantly! The tab is a eye candy to look at with 323ppi its higher that ipad with retina display at about 264ppi I got the tab in just a platic wrap! without any bubble wrap or any protection. Seller needs to improve on packing, other than this I give it a thumbs up!","I got the nexus a few days back... amazing tablet it is.. but one thing i am not sure is whether to use a scratchguard or not.. since they say corning glass does not need one... help would be appreciated :)","No doubt one of slim beasts in the era.. But be cautious about using pendrive .U have to root it to use usb drive and rooting will destroy the warranty.Using the pendrive is no `plug n play` type job..","Nexus 7 2013 tab is one of the best tab currently in the market. The tablet is fast, user friendly, built quality is very good, battery back up is good(could be better), display is amazing, Gaming in this tablet is also pretty good. Only the battery back up could have been better. The pros of this amazing tablet outweigh the cons.","Before buying this product, I have read quite a few reviews and most of them suggested that this is undoubtedly the best android tablets available in the market. I was eagerly waiting for this product, so that as soon as it was available on Flipkart, I ordered one for myself. Flipkart's service has never failed me till date. The first impressions were really good. It was light weight, looks classy and as soon as I switched it on it asked me for an Android 4.4 update!! I have been using this tablet for over 2 weeks now and believe me it works like a charm. Games run without any delay. The display is really good for watching videos. Though I do not have much experience of other tablets, but I am really impressed by the speakers of the Nexus 7 2013. Overall, even I vote this tablet to be the best Android tablet (at this price) in the market. As already mentioned, Flipkart's service has never been a problem for me.","there is no legs while playing a game or video.n most of 25% ram is use....which fullfill our requirement n 75% ram remain unused.and so we can install more games.","Cristal clear display.... Comparable with Apple ipad display...... Smooth gorilla glasses...... really fun to use Good camera, performance.... games loads quickly Slim.....slim... really slim Great build quality..... the rubber finishing is superb..... nexus well written (stylish) Large display feel... cant believe its 7 inch.... its feels to be more... but is exactly 7 inch when measured..;P...:(..:)","I ordered the latest Nexus 7 tablet 32 GB from Flipkart through Express Delivery service which delivered the tablet the next day of ordering - hats off to Flipkart for such good service. Its been seven days since I have started using the tablet and so far it has been wonderful. Readability in sunlight is an issue (as compared to Nokia Lumia which has a very clear readable screen even in sunlight). Overall, a great tablet with good sleek design as compared to the older bulky version of Nexus 7. I have not yet tried the OTG cable for pen drive but shall update on the same when I do so. Rating: Design: 5/5 Specs: 5/5 Display:3/5 Recommendation: Go for it unless you have a higher budget to consider Ipad Mini/ Ipad Air which are arguably the best tablets in the market","This is the best tablet in budget android updates are the earliest thru googles own customary prerogative the processor speed is yet to be tested and tired!! \\Riptide 3, asphault 8, works like silk. you can disable from auto updates to prevent unnecessary data usage(its hungry for that) book reading experience is good not excellent...(tad heavy on prolonged holding) Still thinking of not to root the device coz the android 4.4.2 is pretty friendly wifi abilities/mobile data catching is excellent. gps gets locked in 2-3 secs. Overall this is a tight slap on apples glorified slates.","The best tablet in the market for sure. An excellent screen, fluid OS along with a decent camera makes it a great buy Ofcourse you have cheaper alternatives in the market, but believe me this product is worth every penny. So just go for it.. don't hesitate! Its nexus end of the day","Well many have said before but still I will repeat.. the tablet is legendary. The processor is real fast and the display quality is amazing but the real beauty lies in its design.. Its light weighted and perfectly fits in one hand.. Very impressed by the tab.. the only thing lacking in this tablet is a good camera..","best best best best best tablet buy this tab from google or nothing. it is far better than samsung galaxy tab 3","I have been using this tablet nexus 7 2 LTE 32 gb for a week. You get a little more than 25 gb of memory sapce the rest is already in use by the system . I filled it with pictures taken from my dslr , songs, full hd videos and many apps and now i have about 6 gb remaining. Likes: no lags, no stutters, very sharp and bright screen, it is blazing fast, gorilla glass, every thing runs buttery smooth.....even after a week of heavy use i did not get any hint of lag Dislikes: wish it had more memory space, whatsapp not supported, quite a few of the apps have yet to be optimized for kitkat,","This tab is an awsome one..... The only negative is with its lack of call facility and no memory card slot.... Can u plz tell me how to get 10% discount in flipkart?","So i got this tablet earlier today and i won't give you a long review, stating all the pros and cons because you can find a lot of detailed video reviews of this tablet on the internet. But i will say this: #1 YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS ONE! this is the best tablet you can buy at the moment... go ahead and buy it, you won't regret it. It's perfect for reading ebooks, web browsing, gaming, watching movies etc. #2 Make sure that you have a wifi network at home or else you won't be able to start it up. Nothing needs to be said about flipkart's service that hasn't already been said. Awesome as ever - got the tablet under 3 days, well packed blah blah.","This is my second tab..... First one was dirty swipe.... I inserted sim into it... Its work in mind blowing way to Smooth and too clear I am impressed with this tab recommend it for everyone...Sound quality is of good ratings...I will stick to this tab at list next 2 year","Nexus 7(2013) completely changed what users expected from inexpensive Android tablets when it launched last year - being able to get a great screen, a powerful chipset and the latest version of Android. Thinner and lighter, with a narrower bezel,with twice as much RAM,and a faster quad-core processor(Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset). The great improvement has been to display WUXGA (1920x1200px) with 323ppi pixel density instead of WXGA (1280x800px). Do not expect much from the camera.","I am writing this with respect to the feedback from Mr. Abhi Mishra. => I agree the prices are more in india if you compare them to US. BUT ! => This tablet is Nexus 7C 32 GB (with sim card facility). And not just Nexus 7 32 GB. If you check the price of this version on international website, they cost alot more. => Finally, we are getting 10% off from Flipkart on this with 2 days delivery time (which I everytime get). So I'm happy to pay 28k - 10% = 25.2k for this awesome tablet ;)","Best specs available in market right now and price is quite economical compared to contemporary tabs. Hope flipkart.comes with a fair discount soon. Waiting to get my hands on it!!","If u already have nexus 4 then pls re think as other than 7\" screen & full HD screen,,,all other stuff are dito to nexus 4.","Awaiting eagerly for it since a few months.....but the wait doesn't end it seems.....This is by far one of the best tablets u can get under 35k...I mean it......the there is not comparison till 35k.... Has one of the best hardware tweaked to sheer performance.....and what to tell about the indefinite nexus experience.....","Best Thing abt this tab is support for openGL3. Practically game play on this tab beats Galaxy s4 (the one without snapdragon).Main disadvantage is absence of memory card slot... waiting eagerly...skeptical abt price though.","I was looking for a tab to use it as media player as well as Navigator in my car, earlier i was thinking of ipad mini but it doesnt have a inbuilt GPS reveiver like any other Andriod device. And being a quality product ipad mini is pricey too. But ipad mini or any other Apple device uses AGPS not the GPS, that means it cant navigate in remote terrain like Ladakh and Spiti when data signal is not available. Apart from that offline maps for Apple are not free like Sygic which is free in India for Andriod devices, so the best choice for me was Nexus 7 2nd Generation which has 3G as well.","Cons: 1. The camera quality is not that much good. 2. No calling or SMS 3. A little difficult to find scratch guard and case 4. Micro SIM for 3G","Been using it over 2 months now . its an excellent product. Good battery life ( Yes i mean it ) . Nice Display and with a good cover , it feels amazing in hand.","PLS does it support sim (2g/4g/4g) can it be updated to 4.4 kitkat PLS Google Nexus 7 C 2013 Tablet Google Nexus 7 C 2013 TabletGoogle Nexus 7 C 2013 TabletGoogle Nexus 7 C 2013 Tablet","I have some problems with connecting the tab to wifi network,but i has awesome graphics give good gaming experience good tab for a use of a youngster","Its been 10 days and i have not received my order . I used flipkart just bcoz of his quicker delivery .","It has been a almost 6 months since the time i have bought this tab and i have extremely satisfied with its performance. It has been looking after my entertainment, connectivity, storage, browsing needs without any glitches. The only drawback i found was the cameras on the tab as they capture most of the pictures darker than usual. But since i don't have much use of that section, I was never bothered much about it.","Received a faulty product. The screen goes off often right from the time it is booting, and the behavior is quite unpredictable now. I raised an issue with Flipkart and awaiting for a reply. I still believe, that Product Nexus 7 is worthy stuff.","Very good product, Was using for a month the performance is superb and nice touch response. i have observed that when playing games tab is getting heat very lite and i believe every tab will get heat if you play games continuously. coming to batter performance is good enough for me.","An awesome android experience. Its sleek and fits into the pocket. Not too heavy. Decent touch and display is good. Specs have been touched upon earlier so wont go into the depths of it. Happy with my purchase","Good product. Great display. Superfast. Dated updates.Good build quality. Calling could have been provided as it may come handy.","I have enjoyed using this tab for a month now.. As every one said before this is simple the best display you can buy with your money in this category... Ipad mini retina on book seems to be little better but in real i actually felt this was better.. It does handle every hd game i gave it with ease.. Never experienced any lag as of now.. Those weekend when i have lots of time for game and browsing it lasts a day and on week days with little game and some browsing it lasts nearly 2nhalf days easily.. On the negative side i feel the device itself is little fragile and cant take much of falls without protection... i did once accidentally let it go from 5 ft but since i had a book kinda cover nothing happened... So to sum it up.. great for games, movies, browsing and ebooks but not a bad boys device can should take care of it..","No need to tell about Flipkart's services and Delivery.. They are always excelled in their service.. Flipkart is the only place where I am putting my faith in purchasing online items even that is electronic. So no need to tell about them further. Everyone knows about Flipkart. Coming up to the device, it is the best 7 inch tablet you can get with the amazing price tag in the market as of now. At first I thought it could be boring after some days of purchasing but once I got it in my hands all those thoughts are vanished away. You can always have your eyes on it. It is so slim and the display is so crispy that you cant get it in any other tablet. You can check the review of these product through some tech geeks. I like it because of its excellent graphics while playing HD games, Crispy letter display for PDF reading,1080hd video playback and it is so handy. It is a beautiful thing to hold it in your hands. My advice is that if you are interested in buying a tablet then \"Erase all your doubts, go and grab this one\". I am using it for the past one month and all I can say is it is my friendly gadget than anything I had before. No Doubt!! Its amazing and bang for the buck.. Go for it..","This is an excellent product at such an attractive price. Also, the service of flipkart was commendable. They delivered the product way before and in a very good condition.","it has a awesome look... a great UI and a pretty good camera for using.. for the rate it's not so bad and after intensive research i found this to be the best one.","Awesome product from Nexus as nexus Mobile. I purchased this Tab a week ago and used it as 7 inch Mobile. ( No calling ) with micro Sim. Superb touching experience. I am waiting for 10 inch Nexus tab. Again Thanks to flipkart.","Google Nexus 7 C 2014 32 GB LTE is a excellent product at a given price. I got it delivered on 17 June 2014 by ekart logistic i.e. 1 day late. Not happy with delivery as First time I have not got the product delivered by Flipkart on or before time. 16 June was my birthday and last day for delivery but not delivered. Anyway product was delivery in nice packing and my experience till now is very good. The best part is I got the product by WS Retail @ Rs. 21,500 instead of Rs.27,900. So it became a gift by flipkart to me on my birthday as I got the product @ Rs. 6000 discount. Thanks to Flipkart. Tablet was loaded with KitKat 4.4.2 and got System update in a week for KitKat 4.4.3. I will highly recommend theroduct to people looking for a Tablet and not Phablet as calling is not possible in Nexus. Display is excellent and No lagging not hanging. Enjoy the gr8 services by Flipkart. Take care and have a great day ahead. Enjoy??","Bought this product after much research done on net, quad core processor et al. It worked well with Wi-fi but the only problem was with the GSM (3G) connection. It won't simply work. None of the Google Play Store apps would work on the product via 3G. I had to reset the factory setting twice but again it would not work then i moved for a refund which promptly done and refund credited into my wallet the same day the the product was picked up. Research for the new tablet is on !","Before opting this product,I gone through many tabs but I have not found the configuration like this product.After using this tab it surved my purpose.","After having used Samsung, Sony, LG.... Almost every best android device, the only conclusion I can draw is Nothing can beat stock android experience on Nexus 7 2014. Though extra skin on other brands do offer us some useful features but overall experience is nothing close to Nexus 7. Very very happy with the purchase.. And Flipkart service is superb as usual. 5 stars to Flipkart too. Thank you.","WS Retail has increased the price of this tablet has increased from 22199 to 25999, which is not fair. This tablet was available at Rs. 21089 (with 5% off on credit card payment). I had planned to purchase this product. However, with this price increase, I am not willing to purchase the product at this price point.","It's a great device for rational buyers. If you are using a nexus 4 or 5, this is a scaled up version of that. It's really fast and has a superb display. For the configuration and price point, its currently the best available tablet in the market. Flipkart's service was not too impressive. The product had arrived at the nearest hub on Friday, and it took three more days to deliver it. There was also no option of quick delivery at time of purchase.","Everything is just perfect , specifications, display ,... only one thing lacking is ..company is not providing headphones for nexus....company or flipkart must give headphones with tablet","Well guys you can always find the specifications and its computing capabilities. This is a great TAB to own, and runs graphic intensive games very well. Excellent build quality, stunning look and feel in hands. Camera Pri and Sec are decent, however Primary camera could have been better. But one rarely use TAB for its camera. Speaker sounds low, however still good. I basically use TAB for almost everything including browsing, reading, gaming, social networking and other utility applications. Didn't had any lag in multitasking, 2 GB RAM takes care of it very well. I also bought a Cruzerlite Bugdroid Circuit Intelligent Wallet Case Black magnetic cover along with the TAB, which when turned back, locks the screen. So try and keep the flap open or use its half fold to separate some distance between the magnetic cover and Tab back.","very nice, small and handy kinds.

The tablet arrived at my doorstep the very next day that I ordered! Next- if you are looking for a tablet( without calling service), you can't get anything better than this! The minimal design and the beautiful display will leave you awestruck! I bought this device because it's probably the last of the nexus leanage. If you love vanilla android, go for it! I would probably refresh my review after using it for a month or so. I've never used a tablet as a daily driver and I'm yet to discover the thicks and thins. I'm more than eager to dive into this device, cheers! :)","Fast delivery by Flipkart. Seller WS Retail. Third purchase for me. Very good seller. Nexus 7C - Ultimate experience. Fast and crisp display. Smooth touch interface.","One of the finest tabs, I've used. This one is fast, does all that is needed for a daily routine and keeps going long hours with the battery (with regular use for mails, music, reading and occasional browsing) for about 8-9 hours. The tab is ideal to hold by hand and is very convenient to operate with. the screen is a big plus to the tablet giving the resolution clarity, speakers are good but max volume is pretty low. On the whole a great tablet.","the best tab for us Google fans---no frills and assured quality. Speed of downloads is amazing. KItkat is buttery. Pleasure to hold it in hands, as this offers maximum utility on my travels. And order through FK, you automatically derive the right to look outside for immediate delivery. Good work, FK.","Delivery done in one day only, hats off to flipkart and Nexus 7 is indeed beast of all tablets except one flaw no sms sending & phone calling.","Technical specs apart (which others have covered in detail), this is a very sleek model and lightweight. So while a cover will help, using this tab is a delight. Battery is not great I believe. Flipkart's service is amazing.","Smooth operation and perfect Tablet.. Loved the way it is in my hand.. cute little pal .. No need to Go for Ipad or Samsung galaxy.. its the fantastic product.. Buy it blind hooded..","If you are looking for any tablet in android or if you are looking for any tablet at all then go for Nexus 7C and don't ever give a second thought to it because it is the best!! Speaking about its performance this tab can go on and on with its 2GB RAM, playing a game, meanwhile you wanna check your facebook notification, make a quick search in your browser or do some bank jobs! Name it all and it happens in a jiffy! BEST BUY!!!","This simply supereb tablet in the market right now, even better than IPAD mini in many areas.. and also flipkart delivery is very good....they are selling it much cheaper than in Chroma OR other retail outlets but still quality is same so no doubts otherwise...comes with warranty card and invoice..gr8!!","I am using this tablet since last 6 months and it worth every penny.

They delivered the product in just two days. Touch response and Video display is awesome. Camera is decent. There is no lag and you can run multiple program simultaneously. Although its not negative but for the first time installation and set up you must have Wi-fi connection. While transfering the data via usb to device on xp you may require some settings in pc . It supports 3g /4g sim without calling No external memory Overall its excellent to have this product provide you have the budget of 24K.","Great Speed, Ample amount of space, Robust Graphics & state of the art display. In short its a sure buy. One thing I want to tell all my readers, If you've ever experienced lag in any previous Android device, you'll just amaze to see its performance... It's just NO LAG android experience with most beautiful display till now.","Pros - Excellent Display Quality & Resolution. - Excellent Built Quality. - Excellent Performance in User Interface, Apps & Gaming Too. - Latest android updates - Good Battery Backup Cons. - No calling facility (it does have sim card slot) - No 4G network support in India - Poor Camera Performance - No Earpiece on device As Usual Excellent Shipping & Packaging from Flipkart (WS Retail) :-)","Why in India , this 4G model is being sold ? This model 4G LTE supports 2100 MHz (i.e. Band 17 or 20) where as in India , only Airtel provides 4G LTE network having 2300 Mhz (i.e. Band 40) . So this 4G is of no use in India as of now. If Google comes up with any new model suitable for India's 4G network, that would be a great deal. Again, they don't have a model which only supports 3G + WiFi (no 4G) with lesser cost. There is no point of buying a 4G enabled device paying extra money which is of no use in India as of now. But overall, rest all features are awesome , there is no doubt on it.","speaker blown in 3 months, contacted service centre, they said they cannot fix the tablet speaker and asked to contact the toll free number. service centre address was given to me by the toll free number guy. buy only if you r sure u will not need the service or are ready to throw the device if hardware breaks down. note: Dont buy/encourage devices which have poor or no service backup like google devices. there were three centres in amtitsar when i bought the product but now none of them is giving service. they have been listed on the site just to foool and mislead prospective buyers","I purchased this tablet (2012 edition) on Flipkart somewhere in November 2013 and it has already developed technical issues (hardware issues with the motherboard).

It is written 2G but it do not have VOICE CALLING and MESSAGING. So better you buy anyone else. If you do not want calling and messaging , this tablet is for you.","good one. but with no voice calling means phone could not be done.Good processing speed.Camera is good........................................................................................................................","this was my first online shopping with flikpart n it was great! About the tab, in first week i was using it nonstop n it was a great feeling. After a 1 week, I felt the missing of the calling feature in this tablet n now im struggling to make calls.. so i would say, if anyone wants a tablet with call facility just go for asus fonepad!","I see many reviews about sound quality and volume is decent/good.I don't understand what people are writing about. Volume is too low to hear anything if you switch on fan/you are on a car. I was thinking this as some hardware/software issue and went to asus exclusive showroom. There also I see this tab volume is same. I am not a music lover or a person careful about sound quality. But bare minimum sound volume is expected from this tab. What is the point of having dual speaker if it cannot generate sound. My entry level mobile phone has double the volume of this tab. I tried some app to boost the volume but no luck. In all other aspects this tab performs pretty well.","I would have seriously bought this product if it supported voice calling........OMG I just wanted it..........Skype And Viber wont fulfil my needs","1. Sleek design 2. Value for money 3. Decent camera 4. Battery lifetime higher 5. Android paradise And as usual amazing delivery from Flipkart. Keep up the good work guys!","Guys, this is the tablet which I was waiting from past few months...Oly after grabbing it in my hands I felt like am handling a Laptop as if...The UI is spectacular, talking abt the speed its really awesome no words actually.

GOOGLE plz launch ur flipcover also for this TAB.","Great delivery service by flipkart!!.... I got it delivered within 48 hours of placing the order, Nexus 7 32GB wifi + 3G is an ultimate tab in mid range tabs. Besides the best specs available in the market, it comes bundled with Kitkat version of Android. Performance is amazing. no lag, super flow, crisp display and smooth touch screen is an icing over the cake. Crisp display gives reading a new experience, it feels like reading from a print. No option for expansion of memory is a catch but.. again this is done for better hardware/software integration... meaning better performance. While Samsung is yet to launch its Tab 8.4 pro in India, which will be priced around 36k to 40k, Nexus 7 is ready to place a tough competition.","Just ordered fabulous Nexus 7c 2013 32GB WiFi-LTE model, which is one of the best android tab.

I have been using it since dec 17 2013. First of all Flipkart Service is very good, for some reason i was not available at the destination for receiving the product and they accepted my request of delaying it for one more day...thanx for that... now come to the product... Pros- 1. it's google product, first of all updates come for this. 2. Nice hardware i have been totally comfortable in handling it. It's one of the sleekest and slimmest of the tabs. 3. Lot to say about battery backup. It is absolutely good. I have tested it thoroughly. 5 hours non-stop gaming discharged it. 4-5 hours non-stop video playing can be easily handled. If we use moderately like 1 hour gaming, 1 hours video playing, internet using for 2 hours, and rest of the daily works it will easily last for whole day. it hardly gets discharged when you are not using it. 4. touch is unbelievably smooth, never found any glitch in last 4 months. 5. fantastic for reading even smaller fonts appear clear. 6. absolutely bright screen. all angles view without any blur. 7. real gaming tab. Asphalt 8 works without any glitch. 8. Internet broswing is really a good experience on it. 9. Rear Camera is quite good in day light. The front camera for video chat give clear picture more than u expected. 10. speakers are quite good. Enough loud and with clear sound. cons- 1) rear camera do not have flash. 2) do not support call facility. 3) no case with the product. should have been given by google considering the cost of device. Only these three cons otherwise everything is absolutely fine about this tab...but still it deserves 5 stars.","I was looking for a portable tablet, size 7-8 inches. I zeroed down to the ipad mini with retina display and nexus 7. Turned out the ipad mini was priced too steep and a little research on both the product revealed that they are very similar. The ipad wins in being a premium looking product but the nexus is priced amazingly. The only deciding factor to me was the screen aspect ratio and android OS 4.4 (as I already use 4.3 on my GS3). I weigh function over style at any given time for the money I invest. My normal use: Movies during my commute, games (asphalt 7, angry birds, dead trigger) Pros 1. The price. 2. Build quality is robust. 3. The screen does not score as high as a super AMOLED or Retina Display but it is an IPS LED and does a very impressive job with HD movies and Games 4. The processor and RAM are ample for Day to day use. 5. NFC, wifi direct are pretty useful for transferring stuff. Thinking of buying Chromecast for HD TV. 6. Android 4.4 has so many better features. 7. No voice calling (its a goo thing for me). 8. The camera has many features but I have not used it often. 9. Stereo speakers are pretty loud and I like them Cons 1. The abundance of cases and covers cannot be compared with ipadmini. 2. No OTG (on the go) feature that helps me connect a USB connector to access any pen drive or my OTG pend drive (it works brilliantly with my GS3) so no quick memory as the device lacks expandable memory. But 26/32 GB is available which is ample for me. 3. The screen without a screen guard is a fingerprint magnet so use a good screen guard.","nice tab .. fully loaded features.. super fast .. battery is not the best. Tab without calling facility. u can only use data calls via apps like skype, viber, etc..","nice piece of hardware. a great upgrade from 1st gen. multitasking lags a bit with android 4.4 .2 kitkat version,but it's satisfactory. battery could have been better. gaming for a long period is not recommended, although games run quite smoothly. if you are a e-book or e-magazine reader, or a fan of portability where important businesses or works come into play( I meant this as a laptop replacement in this case, every laptop work can't be done on a tablet), then this tablet is highly recommended. a good cover is suggested with this.","good product, nice packing, waiting for my 4g card to explore my new nexus 7 LTE tablet.. if you are looking for a cheap and better tablet for gaming and browsing , then i'll prefer nexus only..","No words for its quality - An excellent tab ever!

I bought it for my friend and he cannot keep his hands off it. The tab is superfast and value for money. The only drawback is the inability to add an extra memory card. Other than that a definite \"buy\".","What to say about this product. My friend got 2 of this tabs for the 1st time before it was launched in INDIA from USA> I fell in love with this tab as it had got amazing blend of perfect size (portable), amazing scene resolution (crystal clear display), and powerful engine (nice speed and graphics). Playing games is a ultra smooth experience. I have got 2 tables of this - one for me and other for my wife. Now one of my other friend also purchased and also one more want to purchase it soon. So in my group of 5 friends we will have 6 Nexus tabs. Now if u need more reviews on this than why dont u get one and see it for urself. :p","Google at it's best....awesome tablet with excellent graphics and speed....very fast and Safe service from flipkart .\u2026.","Delivery from Flipkart was prompt, though there was a small issue with timing of the delivery. Nonetheless no complaints on that. Tablet is working to my satisfaction. I guess this is value for money, in comparative terms to the iPads and the Samsung's of the world.","pros 1. nice slim design 2. 2 GB ram support is enough to play any tab game. 3. display is awesome 4 . no heating problem , while playing high graphics games cons. no call support.","Issues # Corning gorilla glass still it is prone to scratches # No proper platform to get details of SIM being used. Benefits # Best Display # Very Light in weight # Perfect gripping # Slim As if u r holding a small file # Slides in pocket as if it squeezes itself in my pocket # Camera is good its a tab. @@ GET IT to b A PROUD OWNER @@","Best tablet at the moment . Video playing is a charm. Internet surfing is in a jiffy . No lag, no hang. Folks, you may go for it .","Awesome tablet... Has good configuration and has great performance. Camera quality is bit less but that's okay we don't want DSLR in the tablet. Works smooth on high end games also.","Minus the camera in low light situations, and No voice calling feature (despite having sim facility), This tab is the best tab of 2013 coming into 2014. No hitch, No glitch smooth as silk. Works with charm and has good display of colors plus good battery life. Power management is good as well.(having kitkat helps). Surfing internet is pretty fast. 3G drains battery faster than wi-fi( an observation). Overall satisfaction 100%, minus 10% for no voice call features= 90%. Calling using headset should have been provided. Also, earphones sound is generally average(having good headset is recommended). Don't expect the inbuilt dual speakers to 'wow' you, coz they won't. they are decent not excellent. P.S. Very disappointing that can't make calls. Have to root it sooner or later. ;) :P","Screen: 5/5 Speed: 5/5 OS: 5/5 Looks: 4/5 Touch: 3/5 Sound:3/5 its good for price but not without issues. Compromise made and is pretty evident. It's still the best deal for its price...","The tablet is good, coming prepoulated with the google products. Videos get rendered well, games are good. 7\" in good size for all these and social networks. Camera isn't the best one and the pictures were a bit grainy, still looking at any settings that I could have missed. Do not, DO NOT, update to the latest version of 4.4.2 The tablet became unresponsive to touch and had to be replaced.","This is farmost the best TAB I came accross. Best processor, best graphics. Do buy this without any hesitation","Display too gud....power too gud......speaker volume may disappoint you...but gaming performance and fast fast fast performance of dis beast gonna make your decision crrct .","Hi..Flipkart team. in a word to describe you is Awesome. 1. I got a very good deal 2. Delivery of the product is mind-blowing 3.The delivery person is very informative ( Mr.Anbarasu ) 4.The tab i got has a problem (Nexus -7C) in touch.i don't blame flipkart but the good point is i got a replacement in two days .possible i give 5+ Star 5. Overall the point is my first purchase is my best i ever made 6. A product is good 4+ for Nexus 7C","Few days back i had ordered this tabket and was delivered to me in a day. Ample research was cone before i made the purchase and i ended up finalising the 32 gig cellular version as i dint want to tether from my cell phone in office. Spec wise its a beast and runs bertery smooth. Setting up cellular version is a little tricky in India as you have to set up APN settings manually. Display is the main attraction of this tab and it simply is gorgeous. Overall a great buy for any version which suits your need. Highly recommened and a total value for money proposition.","I am editing this review after 9 months of usage. this tablet i still a great one. but screan quality litrally sucks. just now the screen got cracked. i was mear 6 inch fall. do not buy this device if u have slippery hands. and to replace the screen it will cost 10k. come on asus!!!!! its half of the device cost. its getting outdated anyhow no one is bothered. Thanks This is my first tab.. And I waited an year For this.I am not a android fan buy. But I love a personal device. I love watching movies n games. And this 7inch tab is serving my needs. Best display n raw power makes the gaming experience heaven. Asphalt 8,GTA San,nova anything u throw it will play seamlessly. I charge it to once a day with average usage, but full on gaming it will last for 4 hours. U can easily watch 3 movies with average brightness and headphones. Sound quality is average. But dual speakers makes up to it. With Nfc I could only transfer only webpages with lumia and WiFi direct is still a mystery. I am loving it so far.. Go ahead and buy it. FLIPKART I LOVE YOUR SERVICE... will write on more review in coming days.........","Made for you by Google (Well not technically) but thats the feeling that you get .. Only downside is lack of calls however it doesnt matter when u start using the tab.. u dont feel it Amazing tab all said and done and the ultimate tab i would say","Pros: Screen looks brilliant. Volume is pretty good. Light weight and feels good in hands. Play magazine app from Google was specially great. Battery lasts long. (lasts 2-3 days with a few hours of usage each, including reading long hours). Cons: Touch has issues, specially while press & hold e.g. in Chrome to open links.","thanks to flipkart for shipping me product in just 2 days. when i first saw the display of this tab,i fall in love . guys it has got amazing screen . but the problem i faced is that tab automatically shuts down .when i was recording a video while transferring some data on bluetooth to my lappy. it gave me a little bit worry. second , issue i faced and still facing that it is very hard to acquire micro sim from microsim port ,. really very hard and pin which i got nexus does nt help much :( u will have to try a lot.","Cons: This tab does not have a call facility. If you are looking for call facility it doesnt have. It has a micro sim for data plan only. Pros: Its a good tablet with an extra feature of restricted users, where the users can be upto 8.","I just received this tab 2 days back, the performance is good, it supports all the games(like nova 3, robocop, fifa 14 and many more).graphics are awesome, camera is good, updates with the latest android version(4.4.2) easily, the only thing bad about d tab is that the tab heats up quickly even while playng normal games for half an hours!!! otherwise i would rate this tab with 5 stars","Not a single issue that I could find with this device. Brilliant performance, much better than Tab Plus (P6200), which I bought last year at a similar price range. Well done Google and Asus !!","Hey guys..... as usual i got d product much earlier than they told to delievr me. Its an fantastic Tab. Nexus 7 2013 supr hit. Vry smooth to use. Vry good bttry. Its vry affordable with d huge configuration..","If the Nexus 7 , 2012 was a loss leader, the nexus 7,2013 is a category shaker. Fully loaded with an attractive price to boot, Nexus 7 2013 is the real headache for Cupertino .","I read through the features and even used my friends tab for sometime and it was a superb never before experience. Though I had a query. Will it support LTE in 2300Mhz band which is alloted to current 4G operators like Reliance Jio Infocomm and Bharti Airtel. Because on another website it was mentioned as follows: LTE: 700/850/1700/1800/1900/2100 MHz","Flipkart Delivery the Best..The product was delivered in 15 hours. Coming to Nexus 7, I was at first confused whether to buy Nexus & or Ipad Mini 2.. Though Ipad looks bigger and better build, its priced 15k more for the same cellular model. Thats too much for a product in India. Screen is Bright and with Kit Kat it runs like a Beast. Even with several apps in the background it doesnt lag anywhere.Speaker sound is pretty good. Its definitely worth the BUY..","Just got it from FLIPKART . I got it two days before from their actual delivery date, so I will give 5 to flipkart regarding the delivery. After unpacking I just stunned to see the champ. More I will update after few days.","Bought the Nexus 7 2013 LTE version a month ago and I have been using it since on a daily basis. This is my first tablet and having read all the reviews on many other tablets, I decided this was the one to have and so far I haven't been disappointed in any shape or form (touch wood). I have basically tested most of the features on the tablet and it works like a charm. Couple of things I haven't tried yet, which are, connecting to HDMI using slim port and OTG. Other than that, its a perfect tablet for one to have.","It's a best table at this time. Wonderful picture quality, good gaming experiance and very handy to use.","You don't need to think twice before buying this tablet if you are already an android user. This is the best you can get at an incredibly low price.","I am very happy I chose this one over an i-pad mini with retina display. The display is crisp and excellent; build quality sleek and suave and the usp of the Nexus 7 is definitely its price and portability. The fact that one can easily hold this tablet in one hand is a huge advantage. The interface offered by the latest Android \"kitkat\" is buttery smooth and delightful. Flipkart's delivery was, as usual, spot on and fantastic. Received the tablet in perfect condition and packing. One word for prospective purchasers. Unlike the earlier version of nexus 7, the 2013 version does not come with the quick start guide in the box so don't think you have been short changed by the seller, which I initially did. The Google support site helped clarify the position. Also, the tablet just got hanged 2 days after purchase and did not move beyond the booting icon but got the reset done after going through the process described by others online. A users guide with the product would definitely have helped. Have faced no issues ever since and am enjoying this tablet. The speakers could have been much better too. The iPad mini beats this tablet on this parameter hands down. However, let this not deter buyers from going for it. It is overall, a wonderful product.","First I would like to tell that I haven't bought it from here and got it as a gift from my uncle who is in Australia.In general flipkart has a great track record for me. Delivery is fast and return process is hassle free. Coming to the Nexus 7 2013, I must say it stole my heart the moment I turned it on. The display is brilliantly bright and gives natural colors which are not punchy like Samsung devices ( I FIND THEM AWKWARD ON NOTE 2) The processor is not the fastest on earth but does everything with ease. It is been 10 days since I am running it and no lag whatsoever. The 2gb ram has much more availability due to lack of bloatware which is what nexus devices are known for. Well it is true Apple class on smoothness and ease of operation while maintaining android's flexible chracter . The battery life is so-so for HD games (which you will get addicted to on this gem of a tablet) and the top gets heated. But for reading and surfing web. the battery just ROCKS! Audio might seem low but has a surround effect. If you want more loudness, turn off the surround effect in Google Play music which sacrifices the stereo effect. I have not bought any screen gaurd as Gorilla glass is good for regular protection. Wish they added oleophobic layer on it. On the downside the Wi-Fi version needs you to connect to Wi-Fi for first boot ( you can make hotspot on your phone for that and then data on). Please never buy 16gb version ax it will certainly run out of storage soon. If you still want to be on budget, get Wi-Fi only 32gb from elsewhere. All and all a great device... Stunning display, powerful processor, latest updates and whatever you can think of.IT IS NOT A LAPTOP SUBSTITUTE, for that you can get a Note pro or tab pro 12","Researched a lot before jumping on to buy this little wonder and it is an absolutely delightful toy. - Performance during gaming (even heavy games like Frontline Commando) runs extremely smoothly on it) is brilliant. - Full HD display is a delight. - The look and feel of the device is pretty good, the rubberized back looks very stylish. - The best part is holding comfort (one of the main reasons i chose this over an iPad), with its slim design and rubberized back its very comfortable in hands for reading, gaming and general usage. - One major con which many people have discovered since the upgrade to KitKat is that the SMS functionality has been done away with. So if you have a 3G plan that requires you to send an SMS, it may not be possible with this. So choose a connection that you can manage from an online account. - Battery performance is just about alright. I have not used tablets much but a single charge lasts a working day with 3G/Wifi on all time, an hour of gaming, an hour of browsing and an hour of other general use. However it charges pretty quickly. The delivery and packaging from Flipkart was amazing as usual.","This tab is a nice product from Google and ASUS except for some minor issues. I always believed ASUS is best hardware in market and this product proves my belief. The battery of tablet is not powerful. Drains quickly. For an LTE model the battery should have been of higher size. No call facility or SMS facility. You cannot use SMS to activate services on your micro sim. Rating 4 due to lack of SMS facility and low powered battery.","The best possible tab in market as of now! The screen has multi touch support for ten fingers! The ram is superior to tabs in general. Is a better option than iPad coz obsolescence is higher for iPad thus nexus is more value for money.","Superb tablet. Great resolution (1920 X 1200). No lags at all even while playing high graphics oriented games.Camera is okay, i mean you can't expect a great camera in a tablet that provides you high performance in such a low price.Biggest plus point, this device will get updates before any other android device. Battery life is nice 10 hrs continuous usage and up to 2 days in stand by mode. The only problem that i face is that, the device gets a bit heated only when you are playing high graphics oriented games for a long time so avoid doing that. This tablet would have been a greater hit in india if it would have allowed voice calling too, but again you can't expect too much, be happy with what you get at such a reasonable price :P","I am so overwhelmed by my first choice of buying a tab i.e NEXUS 7 2013 LTE..Blazing speed , light weight, crystal clear pictures , music quality ,gaming .etc .All in one tab. flipkart is best in delivering the product. A happy customer..","This is my first tab ever use, also in first time the android system. after use a week, I feel great. work well, picture quality and other specification achieve. after a long study of review I selected this model for my daughter's study and me. little confuse about the small screen, but its more comfort for me at all. all positive, but I feel much problem about its use. asus do not provide any user manual or guidance. there are no help in sites. so, till the date I do not expert about all its specification and use. I will writing another review after a month. I recommend the product for serious tab lovers.","If you are looking for a product which can give competition to a high end high price product like apple ipad mini then this is what you want. with the same price range there is no other product which even comes near to it. Loving my Nexus 7 (2013) :D","Google have done it again.. value for money... Many fellows have given a better review already I would like to mention following two cons 1. you cannot make a call from this device 2. Battery expires pretty sooner when playing HD and Wifi download parallel If you have charger ports available with you all the time.. Just go for it.. ::))","After reading excellent reviews of this tablet, I decided to buy one even though I had very recently bought Nexus 7, 2012 model. I am impressed but not what I had expected. The colors are jaded and no match for my mobile phone Nexus 4. Even the contrast is low. Also color fringes are present in text and monochrome images. I think old Nexus 7 has more value for money.","i have purchased this tab from flipkart on 19th December,2013. orederd on 14 December. the order i received before the due date. And it was well packed and safely received. Tab is just gr8 with great features. Overall its a great experience buying this tab from flipkart","Everything what i expected is bit more than that, but i still find some issue with this tablet, i cant fix the Bluetooth, as it doesn't detect any device. guys plz help me sort out this problem.","I purchased this amazing Nexus 7'inch C tablet for new year :) and am enjoying it. This is the great tablet with high resolution among all the tablets available today. E-books clarity is more than apple mini. Apps download speed is so fast ...! Gaming experience is very much accurate and this is the best gadget ever i used for gaming !!! So fast....So bright.... So accurate and so handy..! I am very much satisfied with this ! Thanks to Asus and Google.","This is my forth tablet ... the previous ones include, iPad, Galaxy Note 10.1. However, this the first one with LTE and 32 GB, other ones are mostly wifi and 3G and all 16GB. This one is really cool! I like it and would recommend for all of you. My next target is iPad mini with Retina. BTW: Flipkart promised delivery in a weeks time, but delivered it with in 2 days... very impressive!!","I just ordered it from flipkart and let me tell you guys its perfomance is amazin and battery back up is also good... i mean iam a freak game user and it still lasts a whole day even when i hav 3g...","The device performs well. It deals with almost anything on the play store with ease. The 32gigs alongside cloud storage on the 3g version is more than enough - and you wont find the need for external memory. The screen is everything here - its crystal clear and the daylight visibility is superb. The camera's are both effective enough. And while most complain about the rear camera - i think google has kept the spec a little low so that you dont end up looking like a berk taking photos using a tablet. The one issue some may face is with the screen - certain areas maybe dead and you will notice this when using the swipe keyboard when oriented horizontally. Other than that the bezel could have been smaller.","The most apt name for this tab. Beauty in terms of its design. Sleek,thin and with a matte black finish at the back. The nexus logo looks oh so stunning in the middle and there is a reason why its written in landscape. Then, we come to the screen. Oh what a screen! Full HD 1080p of sheer viewing goodness and pleasure. Weather its watching a movie or reading a book, it is just gorgeous & crisp. That's the beauty part. Now the beast. The beast is the processor,the quad core chipset is just ideal for multi-tasking, coupled with 2 gigs of ram. You throw anything at, absolutely anything nd it just chews it up without a hitch. Battery life is also excellent. Very less drain of battery in standby. Even if you leave it overnight, hardly 1-2% of the battery gets discharged, which is very good for an android device. That's got a lot to do with the software I think, and its aces in that department as well. As son as I powered it on and connected it to wifi (it needs wifi for the initial setup) it straight a way asked me to upgrade to the latest version of android 4.4.2 from 4.3. You'll get the latest software updates, only with the nexus,quickly & efficiently. Even the cameras, both back & front are quite decent. The 5MP offering at the back does quite a decent job, and shoots full HD video as well. Quite decent for a a tablet. All in a all a great tablet. The best in the 7\" tablet space. If there is one thing that lets it down then probably its the fact that in Delhi we don't get 4G LTE. Hopefully it becomes available soon. Also there is no calling feature built in, but I guess everyone now a days has a phone to do that. In the end, for me its the best tablet money can buy right now in terms of value for money. The price - to - feature ratio is phenomenal. The I-pad mini doesn't come close to this. If you want a tablet, you have to go for this. If network connectivity is not all that important and you can survive on wifi then the 16gb or 32gb wifi only models are your best bet. I must also put in a great word for flipkart. Speedy delivery. 1 complaint I do have is that they don't seem to deliver in Noida. I had my tab delivered to a friend in gurgaon. Hopefully this will get sorted out soon. Kudos to flipkart and to asus (and google) for giving us (I think) the VFM gadget of the year. You also get a slice of your own Google Goodness!!!","Overall a nice product but its battery is too week and takes lot of time to get charge, but other features are good.","Didn't find anything that's missing for my needs. Well one drawback I realized late after kit Kat update was that sms feature for 3g Sim is lost.","Got it in just two days of placing the order, on powering on the device fro the 1st time and connecting it to wifi it took the kitkat 4.4.2 update instantly! The tab is a eye candy to look at with 323ppi its higher that ipad with retina display at about 264ppi I got the tab in just a platic wrap! without any bubble wrap or any protection. Seller needs to improve on packing, other than this I give it a thumbs up!","I got the nexus a few days back... amazing tablet it is.. but one thing i am not sure is whether to use a scratchguard or not.. since they say corning glass does not need one... help would be appreciated :)","No doubt one of slim beasts in the era.. But be cautious about using pendrive .U have to root it to use usb drive and rooting will destroy the warranty.Using the pendrive is no `plug n play` type job..","Nexus 7 2013 tab is one of the best tab currently in the market. The tablet is fast, user friendly, built quality is very good, battery back up is good(could be better), display is amazing, Gaming in this tablet is also pretty good. Only the battery back up could have been better. The pros of this amazing tablet outweigh the cons.","Before buying this product, I have read quite a few reviews and most of them suggested that this is undoubtedly the best android tablets available in the market. I was eagerly waiting for this product, so that as soon as it was available on Flipkart, I ordered one for myself. Flipkart's service has never failed me till date. The first impressions were really good. It was light weight, looks classy and as soon as I switched it on it asked me for an Android 4.4 update!! I have been using this tablet for over 2 weeks now and believe me it works like a charm. Games run without any delay. The display is really good for watching videos. Though I do not have much experience of other tablets, but I am really impressed by the speakers of the Nexus 7 2013. Overall, even I vote this tablet to be the best Android tablet (at this price) in the market. As already mentioned, Flipkart's service has never been a problem for me.","there is no legs while playing a game or video.n most of 25% ram is use....which fullfill our requirement n 75% ram remain unused.and so we can install more games.","Cristal clear display.... Comparable with Apple ipad display...... Smooth gorilla glasses...... really fun to use Good camera, performance.... games loads quickly Slim.....slim... really slim Great build quality..... the rubber finishing is superb..... nexus well written (stylish) Large display feel... cant believe its 7 inch.... its feels to be more... but is exactly 7 inch when measured..;P...:(..:)","I ordered the latest Nexus 7 tablet 32 GB from Flipkart through Express Delivery service which delivered the tablet the next day of ordering - hats off to Flipkart for such good service. Its been seven days since I have started using the tablet and so far it has been wonderful. Readability in sunlight is an issue (as compared to Nokia Lumia which has a very clear readable screen even in sunlight). Overall, a great tablet with good sleek design as compared to the older bulky version of Nexus 7. I have not yet tried the OTG cable for pen drive but shall update on the same when I do so. Rating: Design: 5/5 Specs: 5/5 Display:3/5 Recommendation: Go for it unless you have a higher budget to consider Ipad Mini/ Ipad Air which are arguably the best tablets in the market","This is the best tablet in budget android updates are the earliest thru googles own customary prerogative the processor speed is yet to be tested and tired!! \\Riptide 3, asphault 8, works like silk. you can disable from auto updates to prevent unnecessary data usage(its hungry for that) book reading experience is good not excellent...(tad heavy on prolonged holding) Still thinking of not to root the device coz the android 4.4.2 is pretty friendly wifi abilities/mobile data catching is excellent. gps gets locked in 2-3 secs. Overall this is a tight slap on apples glorified slates.","The best tablet in the market for sure. An excellent screen, fluid OS along with a decent camera makes it a great buy Ofcourse you have cheaper alternatives in the market, but believe me this product is worth every penny. So just go for it.. don't hesitate! Its nexus end of the day","Well many have said before but still I will repeat.. the tablet is legendary. The processor is real fast and the display quality is amazing but the real beauty lies in its design.. Its light weighted and perfectly fits in one hand.. Very impressed by the tab.. the only thing lacking in this tablet is a good camera..","best best best best best tablet buy this tab from google or nothing. it is far better than samsung galaxy tab 3","I have been using this tablet nexus 7 2 LTE 32 gb for a week. You get a little more than 25 gb of memory sapce the rest is already in use by the system . I filled it with pictures taken from my dslr , songs, full hd videos and many apps and now i have about 6 gb remaining. Likes: no lags, no stutters, very sharp and bright screen, it is blazing fast, gorilla glass, every thing runs buttery smooth.....even after a week of heavy use i did not get any hint of lag Dislikes: wish it had more memory space, whatsapp not supported, quite a few of the apps have yet to be optimized for kitkat,","This tab is an awsome one..... The only negative is with its lack of call facility and no memory card slot.... Can u plz tell me how to get 10% discount in flipkart?","So i got this tablet earlier today and i won't give you a long review, stating all the pros and cons because you can find a lot of detailed video reviews of this tablet on the internet. But i will say this: #1 YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS ONE! this is the best tablet you can buy at the moment... go ahead and buy it, you won't regret it. It's perfect for reading ebooks, web browsing, gaming, watching movies etc. #2 Make sure that you have a wifi network at home or else you won't be able to start it up. Nothing needs to be said about flipkart's service that hasn't already been said. Awesome as ever - got the tablet under 3 days, well packed blah blah.","This is my second tab..... First one was dirty swipe.... I inserted sim into it... Its work in mind blowing way to Smooth and too clear I am impressed with this tab recommend it for everyone...Sound quality is of good ratings...I will stick to this tab at list next 2 year","Nexus 7(2013) completely changed what users expected from inexpensive Android tablets when it launched last year - being able to get a great screen, a powerful chipset and the latest version of Android. Thinner and lighter, with a narrower bezel,with twice as much RAM,and a faster quad-core processor(Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset). The great improvement has been to display WUXGA (1920x1200px) with 323ppi pixel density instead of WXGA (1280x800px). Do not expect much from the camera.","I am writing this with respect to the feedback from Mr. Abhi Mishra. => I agree the prices are more in india if you compare them to US. BUT ! => This tablet is Nexus 7C 32 GB (with sim card facility). And not just Nexus 7 32 GB. If you check the price of this version on international website, they cost alot more. => Finally, we are getting 10% off from Flipkart on this with 2 days delivery time (which I everytime get). So I'm happy to pay 28k - 10% = 25.2k for this awesome tablet ;)","Best specs available in market right now and price is quite economical compared to contemporary tabs. Hope flipkart.comes with a fair discount soon. Waiting to get my hands on it!!","If u already have nexus 4 then pls re think as other than 7\" screen & full HD screen,,,all other stuff are dito to nexus 4.","Awaiting eagerly for it since a few months.....but the wait doesn't end it seems.....This is by far one of the best tablets u can get under 35k...I mean it......the there is not comparison till 35k.... Has one of the best hardware tweaked to sheer performance.....and what to tell about the indefinite nexus experience.....","Best Thing abt this tab is support for openGL3. Practically game play on this tab beats Galaxy s4 (the one without snapdragon).Main disadvantage is absence of memory card slot... waiting eagerly...skeptical abt price though."]}
